# Qiskit Fall Fest 2022

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Purdue Universit Fort Wayne. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by **Purdue University QUantum and AI Center (QUAIC)** sponsored by **IBM** and **PFW Department of Computer Science**. 

We are one of 29 campuses around the world and the only one in Indiana to host the IBM sponsored [Qiskit Fall Fest Events](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/).

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local community’s skill set.

The Fall Fest here includes a series of workshops starting Oct 3 and ends with a hackathon, October 21 - 23. Details are coming.
